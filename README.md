# MAZE-GAME

### Description

Dear Player,

You have one goal. Collect all the treasures. Once you collect them all, you win.
However, it isn't that simple, there are enemies lurking around each corner.
They can kill you in one strike. Not to worry, there’s a sword you can collect
to destroy this threat. They’re tough, they take 3 hits. Don’t fear though,
they may be tough but their intelligence is low. They move randomly with the
inability to sense your presence. The passages within the maze aren’t any ordinary
passages, they loop around to the other side. Use this to your advantage,
weave around the enemies within the maze.

-X-X-X- WARNING -X-X-X-

Don’t forget to look at the other side before entering a passage!
Good luck on your adventure.
